- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Gabriel, I'm a novice fullstack developer at this time but as all of us, am in a perpetual learning. 
- My studied languages until now are JS/PHP and their frameworks and complementary composers like Node.JS/express.JS/React.JS/Symfony & HTML/CSS/Twig.
- I will do my best to keep my account active and upload all the small/large projects that I work on in the hope that others can either refresh, enlarge or influence
- their knowledge, or why not... inspire to work on new projects!

- My hobbies are tied more to art (of course, everyone is an artist!) like: 
-       - Drawing
-       - Dancing
-       - 3D Modeling
-       - Painting
-       - Music producing
-       - Singing
-       
- the last two being the ones that I practice most, and also the non artsy ones:
-       - gaming
-       - watching movies/anime.
-       - walking/sightseeing/traveling

- If you have any project that you think that I can help you on, either coding either audio production, do not hesitate to message me. 
- If I can and have the time I'll be more than happy to do so, based on project details we can talk about prices if it's the case.
